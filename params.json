{"name":"IR RGB LED CONTROLLER","tagline":"Control RGB LED strip remotely with an Arduino and IR Remote w/ TSOP 1738","body":"> ### IR Controlled Arduino RGB LED Controller\r\n> Use this coded to recieve IR Code from any Remote, and use it to drive different mode's and colors on the RGB LED. This code is mainly used in parallel with a ULN2003A or ULN2803A to control 12v RGB LED Strip(Common Anode). \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd rohinrohn/IR_RGB_CONTROLLER\r\n$ git fetch master\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n* Arduino IDE\r\n* Arduino Uno? Or any other Arduino Compatible.\r\n* IRremote Library.\r\n* SerialCommand Library, if you want Serial Command Input.\r\n* RGB LED, to test it, or you can get the Strip. \r\n* TSOP 1738, or any other compatible IR Reciever.\r\n* ULN2003A or ULN2803A Darrington Array, for 12v PWM control. \r\n\r\n## Different Mode's Available - \r\n* mdPulse\r\n* mdSolid\r\n* mdRandomFade\r\n* mdRainbow\r\n* mdStrobe, with fade option for every mode. \r\n\r\n## Known bugs - \r\nThere is an Issue where the IR Receiver Input starts reading random value's when connected to an RGB LED, not the strip. \r\nCan't seem to figure out Why?\r\nBut works fine when using the Darrington Transistor Array! :D\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n**Main Contributor - Rohin Gopalakrishnan(@rohinrohin)**\r\n*A big Thanks goes to Martin Eberhardt DarkFox(@DarkFox) for his RGB LED Control base which I developed on, and Shirriff for his amazing IRremote Reciever Library.*\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nContact (rohinrohin@gmail.com) or on twitter(@rohinrohin) for any quesiotns and I will try my best to help you. \r\n\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
