{"name":"IR RGB LED CONTROLLER","tagline":"Control RGB LED remotely with an Arduino and IR Remote","body":"> ### IR Controlled Arduino RGB LED Controller\r\n> Use this coded to recieve IR from any Remote Input, and use it to control different mode's and colors of the RGB LED. This is mainly used with a ULN2003A or its brother ULN2803A to control High Power 12v RGB LED Strips. \r\n\r\n## Different Mode's Available - \r\n* mdPulse\r\n* mdSolid\r\n* mdRandomFade\r\n* mdRainbow\r\n* mdStrobe, with fade option for every mode. \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd rohinrohn/IR_RGB_CONTROLLER\r\n$ git fetch rohinrohin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n### \r\n### Prerequisites\r\n* Arduino IDE\r\n* Arduino Uno? Or any other Arduino Compatible\r\n* IRremote Library\r\n* SerialCommand Library, if you want Serial Command Input\r\n* RGB LED, to test it\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n**Main Contributor - Rohin Gopalakrishnan(@rohinrohin)**\r\n_A big Thanks goes to Martin Eberhardt DarkFox(@DarkFox) for his base RGB LED Controller, and Shirriff for his amazing IRremote Reciever Code. _\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFeel free to contact me on my mail (rohinrohin@gmail.com) or on twitter(@rohinrohin).\r\n\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
